Alina Kutyno <alina@smartsteeltechnologiesgmbh.recruitee.com>

Hello Volodymyr,

Thank you for your interest in the Python Backend Developer (m/f/d) - Industrial Data Science and Software position
at Smart Steel Technologies GmbH. We understand that preparing an application takes time, and we appreciate that
 you put forth that effort in the interest of working with us.

We have carefully reviewed your application, and would like to invite you to move on to the next step in our
recruitment process. Our engineers have designed a task for you to complete that will help us more precisely
determine your experience level with regards to machine learning and software engineering. The task is not meant to
be especially difficult or time consuming, and because there is no one correct solution, the specific way you approach
the problem is the information that we value the most. With that in mind, please make sure to explain with reasonable
detail how you have arrived to your solution.

If you need more than 14 days to complete the task due to holidays or a busy schedule, please let us know and we will
keep your application "fresh". Please also note that we consider code or expository text that is copy-pasted without
citation as plagiarism, but we also gladly accept solutions that do contain citations.

Technical details for the task can be found in the task_description.txt found in the attached zip file.

Best regards,
The team at Smart Steel Technologies GmbH

****************************** TASK  ********************************************************************
    We have supplied you with a file named 'task_data.csv'. The programming task
    that we are asking you to perform is purposely open-ended. For a Python
    developer with the type of experience we are looking for, the task should not
    take a significant amount of time. We have tried to design it such that it
    should not take more than one hour. We do expect that you will have to refer to
    some documentation, but we do not intend to have you learn a significant amount
    of new Python or general development libraries, tools, or concepts.

    It is the goal of the task to allow candidates to highlight decision making and
    development choices in the context in which we as a team frequently work.

    We recommend the following steps in order to produce the required deliverable:

    1. Create an application that transfers `task_data.csv` to a database
    2. Create a _separate_ web application that is able to connect to this database
    3. Serve the database data (from `task_data.csv`) in a _simple_ html format
    4. On each GET request, log that the data was requested (in the same database)
    5. Package the applications into a _bare_ Git repository
    6. Prepare instructions for setting up and running the applications
    7. Prepare justification for your development decisions as you see necessary

    Therefore, the required deliverable is the following:

    1. A _bare_ Git repository
    2. Instructions for setting up and running the applications
    3. Justification for your development decisions as you see necessary

    Please take care to note the _emphasized_ points.

    Generally, the criteria that is worth focusing on is the following:

    * Simple, clear, and fully-functional set-up instructions
    * Simple, sufficient code (e.g. premature generalization is unnecessary)
    * Appropriate choices of tooling and libraries given the scope of the task
